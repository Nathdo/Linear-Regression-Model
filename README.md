# Linear-Regression-Model

In this project, I developed a Linear Regression model, which is considered to be the simplest model in Machine Learning. I used the cost function to evaluate the effectiveness of my model and also implemented gradient descent to minimize this cost function. Gradient descent is an optimization method that allows us to find the optimal parameters for our model. By using these techniques, I built a Linear Regression model that can predict a continuous variable based on one or more input variables.
